Feature: Api status
  In order to know the server is up and running
  As a health check
  I want to check the api status

  Scenario: Check the api status
    Given I send a GET request to '/health-check'
    Then the response content should be:
    """
    {
      "moocBackend": "ok",
      "rand": 1
    }
    """
